   "description" : "(Previously Vehicle Indicators)\nAdds various blocks that allow making vehicles with precise weight distributions or allow to \"change the physics\" of drag.\n\n[b]Creation Center of Mass Finder[/b]\n- creates particles to display the local axis of the indicator around the CoM of the entire creation\n- shows the center of mass with a particle\n\n[b]Body Center of Mass Finder[/b]\n- creates particles to display the local axis of the indicator around the CoM of the body the indicator is on\n- shows the center of mass with a particle\n\n[b]Center of Thrust Finder[/b]\n- shows the thrust vector of all vanilla thrusters on the creation at the center of thrust\n\n[b]Modes[/b]\nThe indicators can be switched through modes using the [Use] button. There are 4 Modes, which change the size of the displayed axis.\n\n[b]Drag Reducer[/b]\n- lowers the inherent drag of the game from 2.5% speed per frame to 0.5%\n- makes gliding planes and driving cars fast easier\n- may be unbalanced, because creations now don't magically come to a stop as fast\n- [b]may only be placed once on an entire creations[/b] (place it once more if you want fun and glitches)\n\n[b]Scale[/b]\n- logs the mass and weight of the whole creation in the console when used\n- rounded to 3 decimal places\n\n[b]Thrust Scale[/b]\n- logs the length of the vector sum of all thrusts of all thrusters on a creation when turned on in newtons when used\n- rounded to 3 decimal places\n\n[b]Note[/b]\nOn very large creations (5k+ blocks, intricate shapes) following blocks may cause a drop in framerate:\nCoM finder, BCoM finder, Drag Reducer",
