How the program can do this is documented in readme.txt.\n\nPlace the Peer ingame, [b]connect it to a seat[/b] and connect it to your desired thing to receive the Peer's output, [b]get in the seat[/b] and let some application do the rest for you.\n\n[h1]Usage by other applications[/h1]\nThe executable may be used as a slave process to read/write peer data.\nThe API is subject to change.\n\nSee your local mod's folder for more information (readme.txt):\n/SteamApps/workshop/content/387990/1771470800\n\n[b]Create issues or pull requests if you want to help contributing updates.
